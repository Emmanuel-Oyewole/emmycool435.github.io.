### What I learned

I've developed proficiency in essential HTML tags, CSS properties, and the utilization of Sass to elevate my projects. Moreover, I've gained expertise in structuring files in a nested format for better organization. Additionally, I've mastered Markdown for effectively documenting my projects on Frontend Mentor. Furthermore, I've acquired the skill of presenting my projects live on GitHub, showcasing them to a wider audience.
